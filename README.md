Simple Linear Regression Project: Predicting salaries based on years of experience

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple linear regression implementation. The model predicts salary based on years of experience using a dataset of salary information.

## Project Structure
The notebook contains the following sections:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Utilizes NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas for data manipulation and visualization.
2. **Importing Dataset**: Loads the 'Salary_Data.csv' dataset.
3. **Splitting Dataset**: Divides the data into training and test sets.
4. **Training the Model**: Implements a simple linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
5. **Making Predictions**: Uses the trained model to predict salaries on the test set.
6. **Visualization**: 
   - Training set results visualization
   - Test set results visualization

## Key Features
- Preparing dataset for linear regression
- Clean implementation of linear regression
- Data visualization using Matplotlib
- Model evaluation on test data
- Comparison of training vs test results

## Dataset
The project uses 'Salary_Data.csv' which contains:
- Years of Experience (independent variable)
- Salary (dependent variable)

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Ensure the 'Salary_Data.csv' file is in the same directory
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. Observe the regression line fitting and predictions

## Results
The model shows the relationship between years of experience and salary, with visualizations demonstrating how well the linear regression line fits both training and test data.
